The premise of 6.5.4 however is that $X\\backslash\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty X_n$ is empty. This leads to a contradication because the empty set is not dense (Note: This assertion is a little beyond me. I think the proof is that a limit point of the empty set would be a point such that every open set that contains the limit point would also contain a member of the empty set.  Every open set does contain the empty set (I think) but the empty set contains no members so it's impossible for a limit point of the empty set to exist by definition.). So at least one of the subsets $X_n$ must not be nowhere dense and thus must have a non-empty interior which is the same as saying that there exist a non-empty open set that is a subset of one of the $X_n$.\n"
